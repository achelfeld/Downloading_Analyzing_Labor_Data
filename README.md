# Downloading_Analyzing_Labor_Data
I downloaded and analyzed occupational employment statistics from 1998 to 2018. I used BeautifulSoup in Python to download the files, and ZipFile to extract them. 
I then conducted some data probing, analysis, and visualization for an example year and then across all of the years. 
The code for downloading the data is contained in "Download_All" and the code for saving the data to DataFrames, and cleaning and analyzing the data is contained in "analyze_Post."
