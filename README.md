# Downloading_Analyzing_Labor_Data
I downloaded and analyzed occupational employment statistics from 1998 to 2018. I used BeautifulSoup in Python to download the files, and ZipFile to extract them. 
I then conducted some data probing, analysis, and visualization for an example year, and then compared conducted additional analysis using the data across all of the years.
